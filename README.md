#______| Pine Script Indicators

Welcome to my Pine Script portfolio!
This repository showcases trading indicators & some known strategies I’ve built using Pine Editor, using simple math, time ranges (as the Opening Range Session [0930-1000]), session ranges pivots (Asian Session[2000-000]), and many other things that repeats themselves everyday.

#______| Notes
- These scripts are for educational purposes and not financial advice.
- Test thoroughly on a demo account before using in Live Trading or automating it.
- If the file extension shows as `.txt` or `.pine.txt`, it’s still PineScript code—rename to `.pine` or paste directly into TradingView.
