#______| Std. Dev. Weekly

This indicator draws levels from the Weekly Open.

#______| About
The scripts are designed to work in Pine Editor, which is found in TradingView charting platform.

#______| Files
-  Std. Dev. levels usually based on a fixed input for a volatility multiplier (3.25) that you can set for whatever you want. I found good results with 3.25. It is designed to work better in futures, like NQ1!, ES1!, CL1!, GC1!, but can work in any asset.

#______| How to Use
1. Open Trading View (tradingview.com)
2. Go to the Pine Editor (bottom left of the program).
3. Click at the Arrow Down, Create New, Indicator (Ctrl + K, Ctrl + I)
4. Copy and paste the code from 'std_devs_weekly.pine'.
4. Click “Add to Chart” to see the strategy/indicator.
5. Adjust parameters (if any) in the settings.
6. Works in any given timeframe.

#______| Example
This strategy is just a algorithmic confluence for already existing trading strategies.

#______| Notes
- These scripts are for educational purposes and not financial advice.
- Test thoroughly on a demo account before using in Live Trading or automating it.
- If the file extension shows as `.txt` or `.pine.txt`, it’s still PineScript code—rename to `.pine` or paste directly into TradingView.
