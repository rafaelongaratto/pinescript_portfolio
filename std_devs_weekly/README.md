**■ Pine Script Indicators ■**

Welcome to my Pine Script Portfolio!
This repository showcases trading indicators & some known strategies I’ve built using Pine Editor, using simple math, time ranges (as the Opening Range Session [0930-1000]), session ranges pivots (Asian Session[2000-000]), and many other things that repeats themselves everyday.

**□ About**

This indicator draws levels from the Weekly Open and is designed to work in Pine Editor, which is found in TradingView charting platform.

**□ Files**

-  Std. Dev. levels usually based on a fixed input for a volatility multiplier (3.25) that you can set for whatever you want. I found good results with 3.25. It is designed to work better in futures, like NQ1!, ES1!, CL1!, GC1!, but can work in any asset.

**□ How to Use**

1 ⁃ Open Trading View (tradingview.com)

2 ⁃ Go to the Pine Editor (bottom left of the program).

3 ⁃ Click at the Arrow Down, Create New, Indicator (Ctrl + K, Ctrl + I)

4 ⁃ Copy and paste the code from 'std_devs_weekly.pine'.

4 ⁃ Click “Add to Chart” to see the strategy/indicator.

5 ⁃ Adjust parameters (if any) in the settings. _(works in any given timeframe)_

**□ Example**

This strategy is just an algorithmic confluence for already existing trading strategies.

**□ Notes**

- These scripts are for educational purposes and not financial advice.
- Test thoroughly on a demo account before using in Live Trading or automating it.
- If the file extension shows as `.txt` or `.pine.txt`, it’s still PineScript code—rename to `.pine` or paste directly into TradingView.
